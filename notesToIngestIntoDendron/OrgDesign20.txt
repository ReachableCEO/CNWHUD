
Organizational Update:


Board Of Directors (putting board candidate book together Tuesday and will host an initial meeting very soon ) . 

Committes:


TSYS Wide C-suite:


Chief Fundraising Officer
Chief Investment Officer 
Chief Marketing Officer
Chief Revenue Officer
Chief Commons Officer
Chief Technology / Product Officer
Chief Science Officer 
Chief Research Officer 
Chief Operations/Finance Officer 
Chief Information Technolgy / Security Officer 

The C-Suite will be equal footing and will report to the board directly (into various BoD committees).
 
No CEO. No central power broker. 

Each C exec will have a single VP reporting to them for day-to-day decision making and overseeing the 100% computerized middle management system (Redmine). 

The middle management system is fully public by the way: (with exception of ITAR restricted information, TS/SCI material, all things envelope as that's our trade secrets).

All company communications will happen via Discourse (and to a certain extent via Redmine in ticket discussions)

I need to update the handbook: https://handbook.turnsys.com/  to reflect the new reality. 

We will do everything in the open. Stakeholders of every level can participate. We are not our customer. The more that we have community interaction on a constant basis at every level
of the organzation, the better.
