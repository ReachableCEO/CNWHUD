Over the past year or so, I've been maintaining an 18/6 schedule (awake 18 hours, asleep 6 hours).

Here is how I am currently allocating time:

* 1am to 7am Sleep 
* 7am to 8am Morning routine, breakfast , household maintenance (I will check email for anything urgent but otherwise stay off devices/don't consume content)
* 8am to 3pm In the office. I am listening to a variety of BBC (and occasional other sources) news products while working. I am available by e-mail/chat during this time, doing work that can get preempted, holding working session meetings with members/contractors etc. The daily grind of ops, or writing presentations or anything else.
** tue/thur at HQ (with an 1130 to 1230 lunch break with my wife) then leased space
** mon/wed at leased space with a brown bag lunch. 
** Fri at HQ
** Sat at HQ/leased space
* 3pm to 7pm Deep work time (listening to music)
* 7pm to 8pm Dinner
* 8pm to 1am Workout, consume content, ponder on strategic things (yes 5 hours a day for reading/podcasts/thinking)
