\par \tab \b0 By this decision, we institute the resale of local exchange service by competitive local carriers (CLCs) within the market territories of Pacific Bell (Pacific) and GTE California (GTEC) effective March 31, 1996.  Pacific and G
TEC will be required to offer a broad range of services for resale.  We adopt wholesale rates for these services that reflect avoided retail costs.  For Pacific and GTEC, adopted wholesale rates will generally reflect a 17% and a 12% reducti
on, respectively, below current retail rates (with certain exceptions noted in the order below).  The interim rules adopted in this decision also cover the issues designated for evidentiary hearings in Phase II of this proceeding, namely, lo
cal exchange carrier (LEC) and CLC retail pricing flexibility policies, rating area consistency, and recovery of the costs of implementing local exchange competition.  
\par \tab Consistent with our adopted timetable for progressing toward a fully competitive telecommunications market, today's decision will enable the competitive resale of the basic exchange service of Pacific and GTEC to commence effective
 March 31, 1996.   Today's decision will help us meet the requirement of Public Utilities (PU) Code \{ 709.5 that we "ensure that competition in telecommunications markets is fair and that the state's universal service policy is observed."  
Meeting this mandate involves the close coordination of this rulemaking and investigation with companion proceedings including Open Access and Network Architecture Development (OANAD), Universal Service, and the New Regulatory Framework (NRF
).  The rules adopted in today's decision are interim in nature and designed to be modified, as we progress past various milestones in this as well as in companion proceedings.  
\par  In the meantime, the measures we adopt for interim purposes are based on the best information available to us today.  In the interests of maintaining California's leadership in creating a competitive telecommunications market, we have 
adopted a schedule that initiates resale competition now even though the pathway toward a fully competitive market will require additional work.  Accordingly, throughout this decision, we lay out remaining tasks to be completed in this as we
ll as other proceedings in order to make progress toward a fully competitive market.  
\par \tab As we discuss below, although the rules we adopt are intended to ultimately lead to a fully competitive market, the incumbent LECs will likely not lose their market power overnight.  Accordingly, at least during the initial transit
ion to a competitive marketplace, our interim rules must retain certain restrictions on the LECs in recognition of their market dominance.   We intend to continue monitoring the progress of competition on an ongoing basis and will consider m
odifying regulations for either the LECs or the CLCs when justified to allow the forces of competition to work.  It would be irresponsible, however, to prematurely remove regulatory safeguards which are in place to ensure that carriers canno
t abuse their market power to the detriment of the public interest.

\par \pard \li0 \ri1008 \fi0 \ql \sl360 \tx1440 \tx2016 \tx2592 \hyphpar1 
\par \tab \b0 By issuance of Decision (D.) 94\_12\_053, we formally adopted a procedural plan to open all telecommunications markets within California to competition by January 1, 1997.  As part of that plan, we instituted R.95\_04\_043/I.95
\_04\_044 on April 26, 1995 in which interim rules were proposed for local exchange competition within the service territories of Pacific and GTEC.  The proposed rules included provisions for interim number portability (INP). 
\par \tab In July 1995, we issued D.95\_07\_054 which set forth our initial rules for the competitive provision of local exchange service within the territories of Pacific and GTEC.  As prescribed by D.95\_07\_054, entry into the local excha
nge service market for facilities\_based CLCs was authorized to begin January 1, 1996 and for CLC resellers of local exchange service by March 1, 1996.  D.95\_07\_054 also identified issues for which evidentiary hearings would be held, and d
irected the administrative law judge (ALJ) to schedule them.
\par \tab By ruling dated August 18, 1995, the assigned ALJ  adopted a procedural schedule establishing three phases for the proceeding.  The ALJ's adopted schedule called for INP issues to be divided between Phase I and Phase II of the proc
eeding.
\par \tab Phase I was designated to cover issues relating to the institution of facilities\_based competition effective January 1, 1996.  We adopted additional interim rules on December 20, 1995, in D.95\_12\_056 governing interconnection an
d related matters in Phase\~I.  In D.95\_12\_057, we concurrently approved an initial group of CLC petitions to engage in facilities\_based competition.  Phase\~II was designated to cover hearing issues relating to institution of bundled res
ale competition to become effective March\~1, 1996, as well as LEC/CLC retail pricing flexibility, NXX rating area consistency, and implementation costs.\up6

\par \tab \tab Pacific proposes that existing resale restrictions on any of its local exchange services be maintained.  Pacific argues that CLCs will have ample opportunity to compete in the resale market through the 1 RL tariff offering wit
hout the lifting of resale restrictions on all LEC local exchange services.  Pacific believes that the lifting of resale restrictions will cause resellers to arbitrage subsidized services and will undermine the LECs' ability to earn a fair r
eturn.  Pacific is particularly concerned that large IECs will be able to offer customers "one\_stop shopping" whereby all the customer's traffic could be carried by the IEC.  Pacific believes that the IECs intend to use the lure of cheap re
sale rates for local exchange service to also capture the more lucrative toll market.  To mitigate the risk that IECs will be able to take away a significant share of Pacific's toll customers, Pacific proposes restricting CLCs and IECs who h
ave over 5% of the presubscribed access lines from jointly marketing interLATA services and resold local services obtained from the LEC.  Without this restriction, Pacific states it would be at a competitive disadvantage due to its inability
 to package inter\_ and intraLATA services.  Pacific's proposed joint marketing restriction would remain in place until Pacific was permitted into the interLATA market.  GTEC proposes that no CLC should be allowed to bundle interLATA service
s with intraLATA services as long as GTEC is excluded from doing the same.

with its resale service to be priced at "compensatory rates."  In practice, this would mean that usage would be resold at currently tariffed or "retail" rates; Directory Assistance would be resold on a per\_call, retail basis, without the al
lowances Pacific is required to give its own retail customers; and Operator service would be charged on a per\_call basis.  Tariffed volume discounts would not be available for toll resold to customers since Pacific states that its billing s
ystem cannot track toll usage resold to specific end users of the reseller.  
\par \tab \tab On a longer\_term basis, Pacific proposes pricing its wholesale service based on geographically deaveraged TSLRIC.  Pacific strongly opposes setting wholesale prices "below cost," arguing that to do so would be inconsistent wi
th economically efficient pricing; would be confiscatory and financially harmful to Pacific; and would be inconsistent with the Commission's own policy that rates be set at or above cost.  Pacific recommends that all LEC services, including 
resold basic service, be priced above cost in order to cover joint and common costs such as overhead costs.  
\par \tab \tab Pacific states that applying standard imputation rules to subsidized service will result in negative contribution, where the price floor of the retail service after imputation may be lower that its incremental cost.  Pacific b
elieves this issue can be solved through universal service funding that is made available to all providers. 
\par \ul \b GTEC\ulnone 
\par \tab \tab \b0 GTEC recommends a resale pricing policy that it calls the "efficient component pricing rule" (ECPR).  Under ECPR, GTEC's resale price would equal GTEC's average incremental cost, including all pertinent incremental opportu
nity costs.  Among the opportunity costs included in GTEC's ECPR are the profits (i.e., contribution) that GTEC loses by being forced to sell services to its rivals who use the purchased inputs to take away business from GTEC.  For 
\par example, competitors might package their own toll service with basic exchange service purchased from GTEC, causing GTEC to lose the contribution embedded in the toll service it previously provided. 
\par \tab \tab GTEC justifies its ECPR on several grounds.  First, the Commission adopted a "contribution formula" in the IRD decision which GTEC views as similar to its ECPR formula.  Second, GTEC states that a competitor in a competitive m
arket will charge a price for an input to recover the same level of contribution which the competitor would have received if it had used the input to sell the final product itself.  Third, ECPR is economically efficient since it reflects GTE
C's economic costs.  Finally, GTEC argues ECPR is fair since it preserves the level of contribution irrespective of whether GTEC sells the product wholesale to the CLCs or retail to the end user.  
\par \tab \tab GTEC proposes a basic exchange wholesale rate of $25.92/month which could be resold by the CLC to either business or residential customers.  GTEC says this rate reflects ECPR since it is the sum of the LRIC for basic business 
service plus a contribution to margin, and excludes all costs associated with LEC retail activities.  Included in the wholesale price is the contribution from anticipated losses in intraLATA toll if a CLC provides its own intraLATA toll serv
ices via 10XXX.  However, if the CLC end user uses GTEC's intraLATA toll service, GTEC will provide a credit to the CLC, based on 9 cents per intraLATA toll MOU, not to exceed $7/month per pre\_subscribed line, which results in a wholesale b
asic exchange rate as low as $18.92/month.  The intent of the credit is avoid double recovery of contribution to margin from toll services.

ented separate positions on this topic.  We shall review each position below.
\par \ul \b AT&T and MCI (AT&T/MCI)\ulnone 
\par \tab \tab \b0 AT&T/MCI recommend that the Commission adopt interim wholesale rates equal to the LECs' current tariffed rates less "retail costs" the LECs avoid by selling the services wholesale to CLCs.  According to AT&T/MCI, the retai
l costs that LECs avoid by selling wholesale to CLCs amount to 28% of Pacific's tariffed rates and 24% of GTEC's tariffed rates.  These across\_the\_board percentages were the result of an analysis performed by AT&T witness Selwyn (Exh. 45) 
using accounting data reported on Pacific's and GTEC's Form M's filed with the FCC.  From this data, AT&T identified costs attributable to retailing functions such as billing and collection, sales and marketing, and processing end\_user serv
ice orders.  Once TSLRIC studies become available, AT&T/MCI support pricing LEC wholesale services at their TSLRIC with no additional mark\_up.
\par \tab \tab AT&T/MCI believe that wholesale rates proposed by  Pacific and GTEC generally exceed what the LECs charge to their own end users, thus making it extremely difficult for resellers to compete for customers.  For instance, GTEC's
 proposed wholesale monthly rate of $25.92 (plus usage) exceeds GTEC's $10.00 for 1MR, $17.25 for 1FR, and $19.22 for 1MB.  Similarly, Pacific's 1RL rate of $10.32/month (plus usage) exceeds Pacific's $6.00 for 1MR, and, in most circumstance
s probably exceeds Pacific's $11.25 for 1FR if usage charges are taken into account.  These comparisons do not include the additional charges the CLCs will have to pay for services the LECs provide free to their own customers, such as the fi
ve free monthly directory assistance (DA)  calls Pacific provides to its residential customers and two free DA calls Pacific provides to its business customers; nor do the comparisons include the mark\_up the CLCs must add to recover their o
wn internal costs.    
\par \tab \tab AT&T/MCI also claim the LECs' proposed wholesale rates would allow the LECs to make more money from CLCs than from their own retail customers because the LECs would charge the CLCs at least as much as the LECs' own end users w
ithout incurring any of the retail\_related costs.  In addition, the LECs will continue to receive direct subsidies such as the EUCL charge and interstate carrier common line charge (CCL), while the CLCs would bear much of the associated cos
ts. 
\par \tab \tab AT&T/MCI claim that pricing LEC wholesale offerings at the same level as LEC retail offerings, without regard to avoidable retailing costs would create an anticompetitive price squeeze, and would prohibit the CLCs from competi
ng against the LECs on the basis of the retailing efficiencies.  Conversely, if LEC wholesale pricing excludes avoidable retail costs, resellers will have an opportunity to substitute their retail functions for those otherwise provided by th
e incumbent LEC, and to pass on any efficiencies in the form of lower prices.  AT&T/MCI claim that their proposed wholesale rates maintain current levels of contribution built into LEC retail prices, since the tariffed rate is only reduced b
y avoided retail costs, leaving intact any built\_in contribution.  
\par \tab \tab AT&T/MCI also state that the wholesale services the LECs will sell to the CLCs will be inferior to the service the LECs provide to their own end users in five different areas.  Because of the inferior service, AT&T/MCI believe
 that CLCs will be at a  competitive disadvantage, and recommend that the LECs be required to discount the wholesale service by 2% for each of the five identified deficiencies until the problems are resolved.  The five areas of deficiencies 
are:  (1) Pre\_provisioning ordering; (2)\~service ordering and provisioning; (3) on\_line access to local listing databases and line information databases; (4) trouble reporting and resolution; and (5) access to local usage data.

ntered into hundreds of contracts with large end\_users for vertical features and intraLATA toll services at prices below tariffed rates.  AT&T/MCI believe that it would be discriminatory for the LECs to deny a CLC reseller, whose volumes ma
y exceed those of large end\_users, the same bulk\_purchase prices offered to end users.  AT&T/MCI state that CLC resellers should be able, as the LECs' large end users are, to receive toll discounts based upon a CLC's total toll usage which
 AT&T/MCI state can be tracked by the LECs' billing systems.

\par }}\up0  the ultimate success of local competition hinges on robust facilities\_based competition.  Once facilities\_based competition is fully in place, they believe that resellers will be able to obtain discounts from the many competin
g facilities\_based providers and offer vigorous competition to incumbent LECs.  Sprint, TCG, TW, and MFS argue that setting LEC wholesale rates at large wholesale discounts below actual costs would give CLC resellers an unfair advantage and
 discourage investment by facilities\_based CLCs, impeding the development of facilities\_based competition.  
\par \tab Sprint, TCG, TW, and MFS oppose the interim discounted wholesale prices recommended by AT&T/MCI, arguing that AT&T/MCI  have not properly supported their proposal.  TCG adds that AT&T/MCIs' proposal to discount Pacific's and GTEC's
 wholesale rates by an additional 10% until certain interfaces are provided by the two LECs is arbitrary.  Instead, TCG believes that the LEC interfaces should be made available at prices that reflect the cost of providing the interfaces.  T
CG notes that when AT&T and Sprint provide services to resellers, they do not discount the price of their wholesale offerings to compensate their resale customers for their lack of access to Sprint or AT&T internal databases. 
\par \tab To the extent LECs provide discounted service to reseller CLCs, TW and MFS believe the discounts should be negotiated between the LEC and CLC.  If the Commission is determined to set a wholesale discount, TCG states that it should 
be no greater than the LEC's clearly demonstrated avoided cost.  Finally, TCG recommends removal of all restrictions on the resale of residential flat rated service, except to restrict resale of residential services to nonresidential custome
rs if the residential rates are not compensatory.

vestment in local facilities is uneconomic would have the same choices that would be available to customers in areas where such investment may be justified.  Third, with WLNP, local resale  competition could proceed immediately, everywhere, 
and for all customers without the need to await the construction of new local facilities.  Fourth, WLNP would give IECs the same opportunity to provide local service to their customers over the existing LEC network that LECs will have to pro
vide long distance service to their customers over existing IEC networks.  Finally, the availability of a WLNP would promote the construction of new local networks by allowing new entrants to develop a customer base and build facilities grad
ually where it is efficient to do so.   
\par \tab LDDS states that carriers purchasing from the WLNP should be able to resell it at any price they choose.  LDDS believes that the LECs should be indifferent to this proposal as long as they receive full cost of the WLNP. 
\par \tab LDDS believes that LECs should be required to provide the necessary data to allow the WLNP users to bill IECs for access.  If the current carrier access billing systems (CABS) do not permit the LECs to make the data available, then
 LDDS believes the LECs should make the necessary system modifications to make such data available.  If the LEC demonstrates that it will take time to revise its CABS billing system, LDDS suggests on an interim basis, the LEC could adjust it
s charges to the CLC by a surrogate approximating the access revenues the LEC is receiving from that CLC's customers, based on the average usage per line.  
\par \tab LDDS believes that WLNP must be priced at TSLRIC as soon as possible so that competing carriers using the local network face the same underlying cost structure as do the LECs.  Until TSLRIC cost studies can be completed, LDDS suppo
rts using the avoided cost approach proposed by AT&T/MCI.  
\par \tab LDDS finds fault with the concern of some parties that facilities\_based competition will be delayed if wholesale local service is priced at rates lower than the LECs' retail rates.  LDDS believes that the experience of the long di
stance industry belies this argument since discounted wholesale long distance service has existed concurrently with the construction of four nationwide and many regional IEC networks.

ble retailing costs calculated by AT&T.  Accordingly, DRA's recommended rate for basic business access service for Pacific is its 1MB rate of $10.32/month less 28% and for GTEC is GTEC's 1MB rate of $19.22/month less 24%.  However, DRA would
 add back 5% for Pacific since Pacific's 1MB rate of $10.32/month was set at 5% below DEC in IRD.  DRA also recommends that additional usage charges proposed by Pacific and GTEC should be reduced by 28% and 24%, respectively, to account for

e subsequent adoption of geographically deaveraged LEC retail rates.  While parties disagree on the specific levels of geographic costs, there is general agreement that costs can vary dramatically between low and high cost areas.  Given the 
significant variation in costs, statewide average wholesale prices will provide uneconomic pricing signals to competitors who are deciding whether to resell or build their own facilities.  Accordingly, we intend to concurrently develop geogr
aphically deaveraged wholesale cost studies and rates under a schedule to be announced to permit the CLC resellers to compete effectively.  
\par \tab \tab Our goal in establishing interim wholesale rates is to  promote economic efficiency and a level playing field among all competitors.  These goals will be met by setting wholesale rates in relation to the cost of service and by
 assuring that the bundled elements and features offered for resale match as closely as possible the retail service packages which the LECs currently market.  Since the determination of cost\_based rates for  wholesale service is yet to be m
ade, we must adopt an interim solution that will allow resale to begin March 31, 1996, while striking a fair balance between the interests of competing LECs and CLCs, and promoting competitively priced retail service to consumers.
\par \tab \tab Until further order of the Commission, wholesale rates should be set high enough that LECs are fairly compensated.  Otherwise, this would give resellers an unfair competitive advantage relative to the LECs as well as facilitie
s\_based CLCs.  Wholesale rates should be set low enough so that CLC resellers are not subjected to price squeezes which impede or prevent the CLCs from offering a competitive price.  The determination of wholesale rates during this interim 
period prior to completion of OANAD cost studies and price determinations is, of necessity, an imprecise art.   
\par  \b 2.\tab \ul Resale Restrictions\ulnone 
\par \tab \tab \b0 In this decision, we will address the issues of wholesale rates and restrictions on the resale of LEC retail services.  In D.96\_02\_072 regarding Phase II issues which were subject to written comments only, we addressed o
ther terms and conditions of resale including operational interface requirements.  We conclude that the proposed tariffs of Pacific and GTEC are overly restrictive in terms of the limited range of services which would be available for resale
.  The LECs should amend their tariffs to incorporate the list of services set forth on Table 1 below for resale.  Unless the range of services which the LECs proposed to offer for resale is expanded, CLC resellers will be prevented from com
peting in a meaningful way with the LECs.  
\par \tab \tab We conclude that most existing resale restrictions should be removed on the services listed in Table 1 below effective March 31, 1996.  We find the LECs' arguments in opposition to removal of resale restrictions to be based la
rgely on appeals for protecting the status quo with respect to LEC market share and profitability.  These arguments constitute an untenable basis to refrain from implementing meaningful resale competition at this time.  Resale restrictions p
roposed by the LECs must be removed if we are to achieve our goal to promote a viably competitive resale market.  We do not believe that the removal of resale restrictions as adopted in this decision is unfair to Pacific and GTEC even though
 it necessarily subjects them to new risks as well as new opportunities of a competitive marketplace.  Moreover, we are also conducting hearings regarding the impacts of our adopted rules on the "franchise" of the incumbent LECs and on their
 ability to earn a return on investment.

 LECs proposed restriction would effectively foreclose resale competition in the residential market.  While the LECs would be able to offer residential customers a 1FR flat rate which offers customers unlimited local calling, CLC resellers w
ould be forced to pay retail usage charges for local calling under the LECs' proposal.  CLC resellers would be placed at a significant disadvantage in profitably competing for 1FR customers.  \tab 
\par \tab \tab We agree with AT&T/MCI, certain current features of the LECs' wholesale offerings would be inferior to the LECs' retail offering.  For example, Pacific's provisional wholesale custom calling tariff omits key vertical services 
such as call waiting.  Pacific witness Pitchford, however, indicated that Pacific was planning to make call waiting available to resellers.  We direct Pacific to make call waiting, as well as all other vertical services missing from its curr
ent wholesale tariff, available to CLCs effective March 31, 1996.  This will serve as a supplement to the seven custom calling services currently in Pacific's provisional Wholesale Custom Calling Services Tariff.  The additional vertical fea
tures will be priced to at least reflect the 17% and 12% discounts off the retail rates as adopted in this Decision.  We also direct the LECs to make intraLATA toll service available for resale.   
\par \tab \tab Pacific indicated that its billing system cannot accommodate the resale of its optional calling plans for toll service because the billing system used to bill resellers cannot apply the applicable individual end\_user discount
s.  GTEC stated that its billing system has similar limitations.  Consequently, 
\par \pard \li0 \ri1296 \fi0 \ql \sl360 \tx864 \tx1440 \tx2016 \hyphpar1 as an interim measure, we shall direct Pacific and GTEC to offer its toll service for resale on a bulk basis subject to a discount off the DDD tariff rate.  The discoun
ted rate for residence customers will be the average price residence customers pay Pacific (less avoided costs).  The discounted rate for business customers will be the weighted average rate for business customers (less the 17% and 12% avoid
ed costs).  Pacific and GTEC shall provide the necessary usage and revenue data to CACD to enable CACD to calculate the appropriate discounts off the DDD tariff rates.  
\par \tab \tab We shall further direct Pacific and GTEC to implement the necessary modifications to their billing systems to make their optional calling plans available to CLC resellers within six months from the effective date of this order
.  Accordingly, by September 1, 1996, Pacific and GTEC shall file an amendment to their wholesale tariffs making available their optional calling plans to resellers.  The calling plans shall be offered at wholesale rates which apply the avoi
ded cost discount which we adopt below to the existing LEC retail calling plan rates. 
\par \tab \tab We agree that CLC resellers should not be permitted to resell Pacific's and GTEC's optional business calling plans to residential customers at this time.  The business calling plans are designed to compete with IECs' high\_vol
ume calling plans sold to businesses and are not available to residential customers.  We shall examine in Phase III of this proceeding the basis for continuing resale restrictions on the LEC's toll calling plans for business customers.
\par \tab \tab While we are generally supportive of lifting resale restrictions where it will promote a competitive marketplace, we recognize that some remaining restrictions are appropriate with respect to use and user as well as the range 
of services subject to resale, as discussed below.

se services other than at tariff rates.  We agree with Pacific that Centrex should be resold only as a business system to single businesses and not as a network infrastructure, toll aggregation tool that undermines the federal law on presubs
cription timing.  (Section\~271(e)(2) of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 provides that intraLATA presubscription await Pacific's entry into the interLATA market.)  The balance set by the law would be upset if CLCs could give their custome
rs presubscription through Centrex sale.  It would be inappropriate to use resale of Centrex as a tool to aggregate toll from unrelated end users.  We shall consider in Phase III of this proceeding what changes to the Centrex and Centranet r
etail services may be necessary to make them appropriate for competitive resale by CLCs.  We shall consider imposing appropriate use and user restrictions limiting Centrex and Centranet to resale as business systems in place of premises base
d equipment (i.e., PBX).  
\par \tab \tab Private lines are already available for resale under the LECs' existing tariffs.  Accordingly, as an interim measure, we will make no change in the existing private line tariff.  CLCs may purchase private lines for resale at e
xisting tariff rates.
\par \tab \tab Customer owned pay telephone (COPT) lines are already sold to COPT providers, not to end users as a retail service, and are already essentially a wholesale service.  Accordingly, since COPT is very similar to a wholesale servi
ce, it logically follows that there are no avoided retail costs associated with the marketing of COPT.  To adopt an avoided cost discount for COPT service would simply enable all COPT providers to avoid paying current tariff COPT rates by ob
taining CLC certification.

ever, permit CLC resellers to purchase COPT service at existing tariff COPT rates.  
\par \tab \tab We shall also defer to Phase III consideration of whether to authorize CLC resale of semipublic service.  Outstanding issues must be resolved regarding how resale of this service would be structured and how the responsibility 
for phone maintenance, coin collection, and related matters would be treated between the LEC and CLC.  Questions must also be addressed regarding the potential opportunities for arbitrage of seimpublic service.  Another issue involves the im
plications of the FCC's exclusion of semipublic service pay telephone sets from the definition of customer premises equipment as discussed in Pacific's comments to the proposed ALJ decision. 
\par \tab \tab While we find no reason to restrict CLCs' ability to resell ISDN, we shall not at this time apply an avoided cost discount to ISDN because ISDN costs will be considered in the application of Pacific to increase ISDN rates (A.9
5\_12\_043) and we have not yet acted on the Application.  In contrast to residential tariffs, there are not as many offsetting revenue sources to compensate the LECS for ISDN.  Accordingly we shall authorize as an interim measure CLC resale
 of ISDN service with the wholesale rate set equal to retail rates.  We shall reevaluate this interim approach including the determination of a wholesale rate once we have resolved A.95\_12\_043.
\par \tab \tab We shall also not require the LECs to offer grandfathered services for resale except in the case of customers who currently receive grandfathered service from the LEC.  We shall lift the restriction on CLC resale of grandfathe
red services to those customers who currently receive such grandfathered service from the LEC.  Lifting this restriction will enhance the ability of CLCs to compete for customers with grandfathered services.  Pacific points out that in addit
ion to grandfathered private lines, it also has grandfathered vertical services.

\par \tab \tab \b0 We next address the quantification of wholesale rates.  In the absence of OANAD cost studies, we conclude that the existing retail rates provide a useful starting point to determine interim wholesale rates for local exchan
ge service.  We find however GTEC's proposed wholesale rate which exceeds it retail rate to be unreasonably high.  GTEC has failed to provide any evidence as to what LRIC is embedded within its rate or whether the implied contribution above 
LRIC is reasonable.  GTEC's proposal to include an additional contribution from anticipated losses in intraLATA toll revenues is contrary to our goal of setting wholesale rates only at the cost of providing the service.  An increase in GTEC'
s interim wholesale rate is not the proper remedy to address any lost opportunity to generate intraLATA toll revenues.  In the franchise impacts hearings phase of this proceeding, we are already separately addressing issues related to possib
le diminution in the LECs' opportunity to earn a fair return as a result of local exchange competition.  
\par \tab \tab We conclude, however, that while retail rates are a useful starting point, simply setting wholesale rates equal to the LECs' retail rate will unfairly overcompensate the LECs and undermine the viability of CLC resale competiti
on.  We are persuaded that there are differences in the cost of providing retail versus wholesale local exchange service.  Accordingly, adopted wholesale rates should account for differences between wholesale and retail costs.  Failure to ad
just for avoided retail costs (such as end\_user billing, marketing, and customer service expenses) in adopting wholesale rates could result in overstating the true wholesale cost of service and undercutting the ability of resellers to recov
er a sufficient retail mark up to allow for a

ir true costs.  Moreover, facilities\_based CLCs could be placed at a competitive disadvantage in pricing their retail service if CLC resellers are able to purchase wholesale local exchange service below its cost.  
\par \tab \tab The only parties to present quantifiable evidence regarding the magnitude of avoided retailing costs were AT&T/MCI through witness Lee Selwyn.  However, parties' critique of Selwyn's methodology focuses on some key areas which
 we feel warrant examination, and we are not willing to adopt AT&T's proposal without modification.  In the following section, we discuss the four major areas where we found AT&T's methodology to be flawed, and conclude with a description of
 how we have adjusted Selwyn's proposal to take those flaws into account in our own estimate of avoided retailing costs.
\par \tab \tab First, AT&T's model allocates 100% of uncollectible expenses to retail based on the assumption that any uncollectible expense is totally avoided at the wholesale level.  On cross\_ examination, AT&T's witness Selwyn indicated 
that uncollectibles at the wholesale level would be nothing like those experienced at the retail level and therefore his assumption of zero was reasonable.  (Tr. p. 2914.)  In further cross\_examination, Selwyn indicated that he was not fami
liar with Sonic Communications, Inc.  While Selwyn may not be familiar with the name Sonic, our recent experience with Sonic and our recognition of the millions of dollars that company owed Pacific and GTEC when it went bankrupt are all too 
clear in our minds.  We therefore cannot accept the assumption of zero uncollectibles at the wholesale level and have modified the model accordingly.
\par \tab \tab A second change comes in determining an allocation factor for marketing and customer services.  During cross\_examination, a number of parties questioned Selwyn on various subaccounts which did not appear to support his analys
is which was done at the aggregate account level.  A key area of discussion centered around

\f1 \fs24 \pard \li0 \ri1008 \fi0 \ql \sl360 \tx864 \tx1440 \tx2016 \hyphpar1 the Marketing and Customer Services expense category, which Selwyn allocated 100% to retail activities.  
\par \tab \tab Parties pointed to selected examples of individual accounts under Marketing and Customer Services which do not appear to be related exclusively to retail functions.  One of those accounts allocated 100% to retailing was Accoun
t 32.6622 Number Services.  This category includes both paper directories and 411 directory assistance, both of which will be part of the access line package resellers buy at wholesale from the LECs.  Thus, those expenses are not exclusively
 retail in nature.  A second category we found troublesome was 32.6623 Customer Services, which includes costs incurred in establishing and servicing customer accounts as well as billing and collection services performed on behalf of interex
change carriers.  The latter is clearly only a wholesale service, while the former must include some wholesale components as well.  We find merit to the argument that there will be some expense involved in dealing with CLC customers.  While 
Selwyn decried the need to look at subaccounts and pointed out there would be offsetting adjustments in the other categories, that argument is not convincing when 100% of the costs associated with Marketing and Customer Services are allocate
d to retail service.  Therefore, we have adjusted the allocation factor for the Marketing and Customer Services category to reflect that some of the expenses are wholesale in nature.   
\par \tab \tab Our third adjustment comes in the category of maintenance expense which Selwyn treated the same as depreciation expenses.  Our analysis led us to determine that maintenance should be treated the same as the marketing, uncollec
tible and support categories so it was combined with those categories and a single allocation factor developed for the entire group.  In its comments to the proposed ALJ decision, Pacific stated that maintenance and support expenses are not 
avoided in the offering of wholesale service.  However, we are not persuaded by Pacific's argument.  AT&T's Reply Comments have convinced us that some maintenance and support expenses are avoided.  AT&T reiterates Dr. Selwyn's testimony that
 indeed some maintenance and support expenses are avoided by wholesale pricing.
\par \tab \tab The final adjustment relates to overhead expenses.  Selwyn excluded overheads from his development of the allocation factors, which we do not find to be appropriate.  Our analysis includes overheads in the development of all o
ur allocation factors. 
\par \tab \tab Parties' criticisms and our own analysis confirm that Selwyn's methodology is an imprecise approximation.  Yet, while imprecise, Selwyn's approach affords us a starting point to determine a reasonable approximation of avoided 
retail costs.  Based on our analysis of the Uncollectible and Marketing and Customer Service categories, we determined that they did not warrant being allocated totally to LECs' retailing functions.  Instead, we grouped those two categories 
with the category "Support Expenses" (which in Selwyn's model was allocated partly to retail and partly to wholesale expense).  We also included maintenance and overheads and developed a single allocation factor for the combined group.  The 
change in allocation factors results in changes in the overall percentage discounts which represent avoided retailing expenses.  For Pacific, the percentage drops from AT&T's proposed percentage of 28% to 17%.  For GTEC, the percentage drops
 from 24% to 12%.\up6

\par   \tab \tab Our approach addresses concerns raised by Sprint, TCG, TW, CCTA and MFS that setting LEC resale rates at large wholesale discounts below actual costs would give CLC resellers an unfair advantage and discourage investment by 
facilities\_based CLCs.  Our reformulation of the AT&T/MCI model reduces the margin between wholesale and retail to better reflect avoided retailing costs which should help to spur development of competing networks.  At the same time, we fin
d that the wholesale/retail margins we are adopting are adequate to provide a viable marketing opportunity for CLC resellers, while still allowing LECs the opportunity to cover their wholesale costs.

ing residential rates are priced below TSLRIC.  Yet, we did find in D.94\_09\_065 that the residential rates we adopted in that decision were already below the LECs reported direct embedded costs.  Accordingly, while we decline to apply the 
full 17% and 12% discounts to the LECs' 1FR and 1MR retail rates, we still conclude that at least some discount off residential retail rates is needed to spur resale competition in the residential market.  Accordingly, we will apply a 10% di
scount for for Pacific and a 7% discount for GTEC in setting wholesale 1FR and 1MR rates.  We believe the 10% and 7% discounts are a conservative measure of retail costs which the LECs avoid in providing residential service.  Since the LECs 
will avoid these costs at the wholesale level, the net effect on the LECs of applying these discounts to residential retail rates should be zero.  Our adopted residential discounts are a temporary expedient and will likely change, if the OAN
AD cost studies reveal that residential rates are priced below LRIC.  Additionally, the Universal Service proceeding's disposition of rate and subsidy issues may affect the discount.  Our adoption of the 10% and 7% residential discounts will
 in the meantime help promote resale competitions in the residential sector.  To prevent arbitrage, we will continue the LECs' current use and user restrictions on the sale of residential access lines to business customers.   
\par \tab \tab We reject the LECs' arguments that pricing wholesale residential service equal to the 1FR and 1MR retail rates would constitute unlawful confiscation or unfair compensation.  Pacific's claims regarding its compensation levels 
for residential service (Nugent/Exh. 81/Table 2) ignore revenue which it receives from various sources and which subsidizes residential customers.  Until OANAD cost studies are finalized, we will not have a complete record of the TSLRIC of r
esidential service.  Moreover, in considering whether Pacific and GTEC will be adequately compensated under the adopted wholesale residential rates, it is appropriate to consider all of the revenues which the LECs receive associated with res
elling residential service, not just the revenues from the basic

 to the monthly rate for local exchange service, residential subscribers also pay a federally mandated end\_user common line (EUCL) charge.  Pacific's current EUCL is $4.61 for multi\_line business customers and $3.50 for single line buiness
 customers.  GTEC's business customers pay $6.00.  We believe that the LECs will continue to receive these revenues in a resale environment.
\par \tab \tab The EUCL charge reflects the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) determination of the interstate portion of nontraffic sensitive (NTS) costs that should be collected from the basic exchange subscriber.  Because the LECs'
 costs to provide basic exchange service include the costs of interstate access, a failure to account for the EUCL charge in setting rates would overcompensate the LEC for the cost of providing service.  Given that LECs will continue to rece
ive the EUCL either directly from end users when the LECs bill on behalf of resellers, or indirectly from end users through resellers if resellers do their own billing, the EUCL must be taken into account when computing the revenues the LECs
 will receive from resold local exchange service.  Pacific indicates that it will begin billing CLCs directly for the EUCL once it receives FCC approval.  Thus, the LECs will likely have these and other revenue sources to offset any claimed 
shortfall in residential revenues.

\par \tab \tab We consider the adopted wholesale rates to be consistent with the pricing principles established in IRD.  In D.95\_07\_054, we asked for comment on the following statement:  "If the Commission considers Pacific's and GTEC's ba
sic service a monopoly building block and concludes that presently there are no competitive elements in basic service, then the price of basic service must equal the tariffed rate element of the monopoly building block, the actual price for 
service."  We agree with AT&T/MCI that the relevant monopoly building block is the underlying wholesale distribution, switching, and transport service.  Accordingly, the wholesale price can be lower than the retail price of basic service to 
the extent the latter includes avoidable retailing costs.
\par \tab \tab In addition to the monthly recurring charges applicable to wholesale service, the LECs will incur one\_time costs when a LEC customer transfers to a CLC reseller.  These nonrecurring costs relate to the administrative work inv
olved in transferring a customer's account from the LEC's billing and accounting system to that of the CLC reseller.  In their proposed wholesale tariffs, neither Pacific or GTEC indicated what they proposed for nonrecurring charges related 
to the transfer of a LEC customer to a CLC reseller.  
\par \tab \tab As an interim measure, we shall limit the amount that LECs may impose as a nonrecurring charge to the existing retail tariff charges applicable to the transfer of a customer account who remains at the same service location, le
ss avoided retailing costs.  These rates are found in Pacific's tariff schedule Cal PUC No. A3, Network and Exchange Services, and in GTEC's tariff schedule Cal PUC No. A\_41, Service Connection, Move, and Change Charges.  We find that these
 charges are the best interim proxies for the nonrecurring charges applicable to switching customers from LECs to CLC resellers.

the CLCs, consumers will not obtain the best prices or the widest array of services that they could otherwise.  For example, Pacific states if the LECs are the low cost producers, consumers may still be unable to buy services at the lowest c
ost because of the pricing restrictions placed on the LECs.  The LECs further argue that handicapping them is not in the public interest because it blocks the normal functioning of the market through artificial government intervention, resul

o exclude competition."  (Ex.\~30, p. 7.)  MCI's Dr. Cornell defined market power as "the ability by a firm to raise prices above competitive level prices...and sustain that price increase for some nontransitory period of time."  (9 RT 1409.
)  GTEC's Mr. Wilks defined market power as "the ability to restrict the entrance of new providers based solely upon GTEC's presence."  (Ex. 34, p. 31.)
\par }}\up0  sufficient to deter entry by CLCs into the local market.  Even if the LECs do possess market power, GTEC states there is no evidence that it will hinder the development of competition.   
\par \tab \tab According to the LECs, several factors demonstrate their lack of market power.  First, the LECs already face competition in existing competitive markets such as intraLATA toll.  The LECs believe they will face equally stiff co
mpetition in the local exchange market.  Second, the LECs believe that the sheer number of petitioners seeking to offer local exchange service (66 as of September 1, 1995) demonstrates that local exchange competition will be immediate and ro
bust.  Third, the LECs note that among the new entrants are large, well\_financed competitors with great expertise in the telecommunications industry, such as AT&T, MCI, and Sprint.  The LECs believe that the presence of these large and skil
led competitors assures vigorous competition.  Finally, the LECs state their competitors will enjoy a significant competitive advantage in their ability to bundle all telecommunications services to create valuable packages for customers -\_ 
something the LECs cannot do because of their lack of interLATA authority.  
\par \tab \tab The LECs also argue that they lack market power because there are no significant barriers to entry.  According to the LECs, the only barrier to entry was removed when the Commission allowed facilities\_based competition to beg
in on January 1, 1996, and resale competition to commence on March 1, 1996.  In addition, GTEC states that even if some entry barriers remain, they will either be removed or diminished significantly by the rules issued in this proceeding.  G
TEC states that the new rules for interconnection, unbundling, resale, interim number portability, E\_911, and ancillary LEC services adopted in this proceeding will restructure the local exchange market, facilitate market entry, and further
 reduce the LECs' market power.  
\par \tab \tab The LECs deny that competition will develop only slowly.  Both LECs cite the 66 CLC petitions as evidence that competitors are poised to grab market share from the LECs.  GTEC adds that it tried, but was unable, to discover fr
om the Coalition evidence about the level of competition GTEC will face.  GTEC thus believes there is no evidence that CLCs will not immediately and vigorously pursue the local exchange market.
\par \tab \tab GTEC argues that the LECs will have little opportunity or incentive to abuse their diminishing market power.  GTEC believes the facilities\_based CLCs will provide many substitute capabilities, and any abuse by the LECs will c
ause customers to abandon the LECs for the CLCs.

\par \tab \tab Citizens believes that the LECs possess market power by virtue of their control over essential facilities.  In recognition of the LECs' market power, Citizens recommends that a LEC should only be allowed pricing flexibility wi
thin defined geographic areas and on a service by service basis, and only if the following conditions are met.  First, the LEC removes a key barrier to entry by providing nondiscriminatory interconnection to essential inputs.  Second, an aut
horized competitor enters a defined geographic area of the incumbent LEC's territory to provide a comparable competitive service.  Finally, the competitor is not solely reselling a bundled LEC offering.  
\par \tab \tab Citizens disagrees with the Coalition's recommendation that the LECs be denied pricing flexibility until the incumbent LECs have met criteria beyond those recommended by Citizens.  Citizens believes that withholding pricing fl
exibility from the incumbent LECs would give the LECs little incentive to freely open their facilities and market to competitors.  Citizens believes that as long as an incumbent LEC demonstrates that it has opened its facilities to competito
rs on a nondiscriminatory basis, the Commission should allow the LEC the flexibility necessary to compete for services in those geographic areas where the LEC faces competition.

\par \pard \li0 \ri1296 \fi0 \ql \sl360 \tx1440 \hyphpar1 \tab To promote the development of competition, the Coalition recommends that the Commission: (1) eliminate barriers to entry; (2) identify services subject to effective competition a
nd significant market power, and (3) adopt efficient pricing for inputs that are subject to monopoly power which are sold to downstream competitors.  The Coalition identifies four specific barriers to entry that must be removed before compet
ition will be able to develop:  (1) the absence of true number portability; (2)\~the absence of access to LEC data bases including SS7 signaling; (3) the absence of access to numbering resources; and (4) the lack of interconnection arrangeme
nts.  To protect competition, the Coalition recommends four polices:  (1) removal of resale restrictions, (2) unbundling, (3) imputation, and (4)\~design of nondiscriminatory interconnection rules.  
\par \tab The Coalition states that CLCs should be subject to fewer regulations than LECs because the CLCs lack market power in the local exchange market.  Because the CLCs lack market power, the Coalition believes that the market will effec
tively discipline CLCs' behavior.  For example, the Coalition states a CLC cannot obtain customers unless its rates are lower and/or its service is better than the LEC's.  Thus, Commission regulation is unnecessary to ensure that CLCs' rates
 are not excessive.  Because CLCs lack market power, the Coalition believes that additional regulation would impose costs without any offsetting public policy benefits, and create an unnecessary barrier to entry.  
\par \tab The Coalition cites several Commission precedents of tailoring regulation to a level commensurate with (but inversely proportional to) the degree of market power a utility possesses.  \tab The Coalition recommends that until there 
is solid evidence that competition for Category I services has taken hold, the LECs must not be granted any additional regulatory flexibility for these services.  Otherwise, the Coalition believes that the LECs will use their market power an
d new\_found regulatory flexibility to impede the development of local competition.
\par \ul \b DRA\ulnone 
\par \tab \b0 Given the CLCs' nondominant status, DRA believes that no public interest would be served by imposing the same pricing regulations on the CLCs that are presently on (and appropriate for) the LECs.  DRA believes that CLCs will ha
ve no market power at the start of local competition due to their almost complete lack of market share.  DRA believes that CLCs will have difficulty capturing market share and eroding the LECs' market power as long as barriers to competition
 remain, including:  absence of true number portability; lack of CLC access to LEC data bases, including SS7 signalling; lack of CLC access to numbering resources; and lack of interconnection arrangements.   Conversely, DRA believes that the
 LECs will initially have substantial market power since they will have virtually the entire market for local services.  
\par \tab DRA anticipates that competition will evolve only gradually.  DRA believes that regulation of the LECs should steadily be relaxed as the market becomes more competitive.  However, before ending the economic regulation of the LECs, 
DRA recommends that the Commission make a formal finding that effective competition actually exists.  According to DRA, the preconditions to an effectively competitive marketplace include intraLATA equal access and interLATA relief.  In dete
rmining whether an effectively competitive marketplace actually exists, DRA recommends the Commission evaluate:  (1) breadth of the relevant market; (2) LEC market share; (3) ease of market entry and exit; (4) ability of competitors to expan
d capacity and capture sales; (5) willingness of customers to switch providers; (6) price elasticity of demand; and (7) the percentage of customers for whom choice is available and the percentage that

s, and that the Commission should avoid any action which would impede investment in competing local exchange networks.

at both the LECs and the Coalition offer unacceptably extreme standards by which to evaluate the issue of pricing flexibility.  While the Coalition would have us grant the LECs no flexibility, the LECs believe we should immediately move its 
local exchange services to Category\~II subject to immediate pricing flexiblity.  GTEC advocates eliminating a wide range of regulatory restrictions on the LECs which are not applicable to CLCs.  
\par \tab \tab While we find that varying degrees of competition can be expected in certain market segments within Pacific's and GTEC's service territory in the near term, we do not find evidence that Pacific and GTEC will automatically lose
 their dominant market position overnight merely because CLCs have been granted certificates to enter the local exchange market.  Yet, we do find evidence to indicate that CLCs are poised to aggressively compete with the LECs for a share of 
their local exchange market to the extent remaining barriers permit.  Accordingly, we shall grant limited additional pricing flexibility to the LECs effective March 31, 1996 in relation to the degree of competition we expect to materialize i
n the immediate future.  It would be premature, however, to make sweeping changes in LEC pricing rules at this point before competition has become sufficiently developed.  LEC pricing flexibility must be granted in progressive stages in prop
ortion to the responsiveness of the market to competition.  Our adopted rules have laid the groundwork for CLCs to begin to compete, and we intend to monitor the progress of competition and continue to adjust our interim rules accordingly. 
\par \tab \tab Since January 1, 1996, the legal entry restrictions have been removed with respect to facilities\_based offering of local exchange service by CLCs within the territories of Pacific and GTEC.  Effective March 31, 1996, the lega
l restrictions on 
\par entry for CLCs seeking to resell the LECs' basic exchange service will also be lifted.  Thus, CLCs can compete either by resale or by offering service using their own facilities through interconnection to the LECs' network.  While CLCs 
will face different problems and opportunities depending on which of these options is used, there will be at least initial competitive inertia and handicaps to overcome under either approach.  The listing of constraints cited by the Coalitio
n and enumerated above illustrate the fact that CLCs will not immediately be able to competitively penetrate LEC markets on a widespread basis.     
\par \tab \tab While our adopted interim rules enable facilities\_based CLCs to arrange interconnection with the LEC network, it remains for the CLC to negotiate a successful interconnection arrangement and to build or acquire the facilities
 to enable it to serve customers.  The CLC will also remain at a competitive disadvantage with respect to access to LEC numbering resources.  Particularly because of the scarcity of numbering resources within California, CLC access to number
ing resources in certain densely populated markets may be constrained.  While we will soon adopt rules requiring the LECs to offer interim number portability to the CLCs, the interim number portability methods employed will still result in i
nferior service relative to the LECs in certain respects.  Until permanent service provider number portability is implemented, facilities\_based CLCs will be at a competitive disadvantage in this respect.  
\par \tab \tab Nonetheless, facilities\_based CLCs will also realize certain offsetting competitive advantages relative to the LECs.  Facilities\_based CLCs will be able to define their service territories in a manner which offers the best p
rofit opportunities and will be able to compete in low cost areas against LECs and CLC resellers who are constrained by statewide average rates.  
\par \tab \tab CLC resellers, however, will have certain inherent competitive advantages particularly in the near term over facilities\_based CLCs.  CLC resellers will not be constrained by the need to build extensive facilities since they w
ill merely be reselling service provided by another carrier's facilities.  Yet, they will still be largely dependent upon the LECs who will still control the facilities over which the resale service is provided.  We have sought to establish 
wholesale rates which will approximate costs of wholesale service.  Because of the uncertainty over the true costs of wholesale service (to be determined in OANAD), the ability of CLC resellers to obtain a significant share of the local exch
ange market remains to be seen. 
\par \tab \tab While we recognize that certain CLCs represent large entities which are national or international in scope, we must focus our analysis on the competitiveness of the local exchange markets within the service territories of Paci
fic and GTEC.  We believe that the access to capital, the ability to bundle toll, long distance and local services, as well as the skilled telecommunications expertise of such large entities will be  significant factors in those CLCs' abilit
y to penetrate the LECs' markets.  Nonetheless, it will still take some time for this process of market penetration to occur.  Moreover, large IECs will be constrained from the joint marketing of long distance and local service, as provided 
in the recently enacted Federal Telecommunications Act.
\par \tab \tab As discussed in further detail below, we conclude that the presence of CLCs poised to enter the market already creates sufficient basis to provide some additional regulatory flexibility to the LECs immediately in certain respe
cts.  We also conclude that further pricing flexibility will be appropriate once critical threshold events occur, as we discuss below.

\li0 \ri1296 \fi0 \ql \sl360 \tx864 \tx1440 \hyphpar1  \tab One of the key factors to be considered in granting future pricing flexibility is the extent to which competition develops and customers throughout California have a real choice in 
selecting a local provider.  While it is clear that the local exchange market is not sufficiently competitive to lift all pricing restrictions presently imposed on the LECs, it remains to be determined exactly what threshold should be used t
o determine when competition is sufficiently robust to eliminate the need for remaining restrictions.  
\par \tab \tab We appreciate that the measurement of market power is a difficult matter, and parties have not provided sufficiently detailed proposals to develop a definitive process for determining market power or translating it into specif
ic pricing policies.  Accordingly, while we find the list of criteria offered by the Coalition and DRA a useful starting point to evaluate the progress of competition, further development is needed to produce and implement a means of evaluat
ing changes in the LECs' market power.  Accordingly at this time, we will not adopt any specific value for market share losses or other measures as definitive evidence of a competitive market.  We find the proposed 15% market share loss stan
dard to be too arbitrary for use in determining whether to grant additional pricing flexibility.  We will consider in Phase III of this proceeding the development of more specific benchmark criteria for finding that a competitive market exis
ts.  
\par \tab \tab We conclude, however, that certain pricing flexibility measures can be implemented effective March 31, 1996 while additional flexibility can be implemented following adoption of appropriate costing/pricing studies.  We conside

\par \tab \tab \b0 Pacific and GTEC recommend that all Category I services for which competition is permitted be immediately moved to Category II or be accorded the same pricing flexibility as services presently in Category II.  Pacific and 
GTEC believe this would be consistent with several Commission decisions, including D.94\_09\_065 where the Commission moved newly competitive services, such as toll and Centrex, from Category I to Category\~II.  Pacific and GTEC state that C
ategory II pricing flexibility is justified by the competitive threat they face as evidenced by the 66 CLC petitions filed thus far.\up6

tiary hearings.  Use of the stricken material is completely inappropriate and may constitute a violation of Rule 1 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure.  We will disregard the stricken material since it has no evidentiary valu
e.  
\par 
\par      A motion to strike portions of GTEC's opening and reply briefs was filed on January 23, 1996, by the Coalition on the basis that GTEC's briefs improperly cite documents and other information which were not admitted into evidence, a
nd therefore, not part of the record in this case.  None of the portions of GTEC's briefs which have been cited in the motion to strike have been relied upon as a basis for this decision.  Before a ruling on the motion to strike, however, GT
EC and other parties will have an opportunity to file a reply to the motion.
\par 
\par   }}\up0   Furthermore, Pacific and GTEC believe that Category II pricing flexibility will enable them to lower prices and bring the benefits of competition to California.  Pacific adds that if the LECs are not granted pricing flexibili
ty, price umbrellas will result which will harm consumers.  Pacific states that Category\~II pricing flexibility will not harm competition since cost\_based Category II price floors prevent LECs from pricing below cost, and Category II price
 caps prevent LECs from charging monopoly prices. 
\par \tab \tab Pacific states that services moved from Category I to Category II would initially have no price floors, but that the price floors could be developed in the OANAD proceeding and put into place during the second quarter of 1996.
  GTEC, on the other hand, asks that the Commission's review and approval process of price floors not delay the granting of pricing flexibility on an expeditious basis.

l necessary functions, features, and services required by CLCs.  An element should be deemed necessary if it is required by the CLC to provide comparable service, cannot be reasonably duplicated, and there is no economic alternative to the c
ompetitor in terms of quality, quantity, and price.  
\par \tab \tab According to Citizens, essential inputs should be tariffed and priced at TSLRIC.  Because of the large number of inputs needed by new entrants, Citizens believes that it will initially be necessary to employ the imputation pri
nciples adopted in the IRD decision (D.94\_09\_065) to price many of the necessary inputs.  As an alternative, Citizens recommends a "short cut" method to pricing necessary inputs to expedite opening the local exchange market to competition.
  Citizen's "short cut" approach is to employ price ceilings rather than price floors.  Citizens believes this would avoid the LECs having to produce countless complex cost studies and a concurrent need for the Commission to scrutinize all o
f the studies.  Where cost studies are available, the Commission should continue to use a price floor and imputation analysis, but where cost studies have not yet been developed, the Commission could use the "short cut" price ceiling approac

\par \tab \tab The Coalition believes the proper procedure for LECs to seek pricing flexibility is under the rules established by NRF (D.89\_10\_031).  According to the Coalition, the Commission anticipated the development of competition for
 all LEC services and structured NRF so as to allow for the reclassification of services upon petition and evidentiary showing by the LECs.  The Coalition recommends that the Commission review the LEC's request for pricing flexibility under 
the NRF framework on a service by service basis.  
\par \tab \tab The Coalition notes that the Commission granted AT&T pricing flexibility only after a demonstration that its market power had significantly diminished.  The specific criteria used by the Commission in D.86\_07\_017 to assess A
T&T's market power and the level of pricing flexibility that was warranted were as follows:  The market share of AT&T and its competitors; the extent of facilities ownership by competitors; the ease of market entry and exit; the size of indi
vidual carriers; customer satisfaction; and changes in prices and the mix of available services.  The Coalition states that the Commission later refined in D.93\_02\_010 the criteria for assessing AT&T's market power to eight criteria.
\par \tab \tab In analyzing a LEC's request for pricing flexibility for a service, the Coalition believes the Commission should evaluate the LEC's market power over the service using the same eight criteria established in D.93\_02\_010.  The
se criteria are:  (1) determination of the relevant market, (2) market share, (3)\~LEC and CLC earnings, (4) ownership of facilities by other carriers, (5) ease of market entry and exit, (6) individual carriers' size and growth potential, (7
) equal access and other technical factors, and (8) service options and customer satisfaction.  By following this approach, the Coalition states the LECs will be granted pricing flexibility commensurate with the lessening of their market pow
er as measurable competition actually emerges.  
\par \tab \tab If the Commission decides in this proceeding that LECs should be allowed to reclassify Category I services to Category\~II, the Coalition recommends that the Commission first remove barriers to competition.  Specifically, befo
re allowing basic exchange services to become Category II services, the Coalition believes there must be: (1) TSLRIC studies performed and price floors in place; (2) price, terms, and conditions that allow facilities\_based and resale compet
ition; (3) true number portability; (4) access to LEC databases, including SS7; (5) CLC access to numbering resources; and (6) interconnection arrangements.   
\par \ul \b DRA\ulnone 
\par \tab \tab \b0 Even though DRA believes the LECs will have substantial market power at the outset of competition, DRA believes that the LECs should be allowed pricing flexibility for most local exchange services.  DRA believes that the o
pening of the local exchange market to competition results in most local exchange services being "partially" competitive and thus qualifying for Category II pricing flexibility.  However, DRA recommends pricing flexibility only be allowed af
ter cost\_based price floors and ceilings are established.  Moreover, DRA recommends keeping certain services in Category I due to their continued monopoly status until competition for these services becomes more evident (i.e., basic service
 elements, 911 service, and public policy payphones).
\par \tab \b 2.  \ul Discussion\ulnone

this recategorization.  While we acknowledge that the LECs will continue to retain significant market power at least during the initial implementation of competition, our institution of competitive local exchange service as outlined in this 
and previous orders creates a "partially competitive" market consistent with the Category II definition.  
\par \tab \tab We will retain Category I status for certain limited services.  We shall adopt DRA's proposal to retain Category I status for the following services:  public policy payphones, 
\par 911\~services, and basic service elements (BSEs) as well as for basic network functions developed in OANAD.  Because of the  unique public policy and safety characteristics of public policy payphones and 911 services, it is appropriate 
to retain Category\~I status for them.  Since BSEs represent bottleneck elements of the LEC networks, they do not exhibit the characteristics of partially competitive services and should remain in Category I.  We shall also retain Category I
 status for collocation and the Network Interconnection Charge since these remain monopoly services.  We shall reclassify most remaining local exchange services to Category II effective March 31, 1996.  As defined in the IRD decision, Catego
ry II services are subject to flexible pricing rules within established floor and ceiling limits.  The revised listing of Category I and Category II services is set forth on Table 2 below:

cause price floors for the remaining reclassified Category II services have not yet been established, however, the LECs shall not be immediately authorized to implement Category II price flexibility on March 31, 1996.  This restriction is co
nsistent with our policy stated in the IRD proceeding that "[b]efore an LEC may exercise pricing flexibility for Category II services...it must establish a price floor for the service."  (D.94\_09\_065, p. 284.)
\par \tab Similarly, in our recent decision to move local transport (LTR) services from Category I to Category II, we identified two criteria for deciding whether to recategorize a service as Category\~II:  (1) whether sufficient competition
 exists within the market, and (2) whether the LECs have submitted cost study data sufficient to establish price floors required for Category II pricing flexiblity (D.95\_04\_073, pp. 41\_42).  In that decision, we found that the LTR service
 met the first prong of the test, but not the second.  Thus, we reclassified LTR service to Category II, but required the LECs to submit cost data which would be used to establish price floors.  
\par \tab We shall follow a similar approach for the reclassified Category II local exchange services.  The LECs will be permitted to implement pricing flexiblity for tariffed Category II services once relevant price floors are established f
or the reclassified services.  The process of establishing price floors is currently underway in the OANAD proceeding.  Until appropriate price floors are approved, the LECs shall be required to continue pricing these services at existing ta
riffed rates.  Before we approve price floors for these reclassified Category II services, we shall consider in the NRF proceeding how to develop and use price floors for exercising pricing flexibility.

r those services which are moved from Category I to Category II pursuant to this decision, we shall establish the following provision.  We shall consider approval of LECs' advice letter requests for pricing flexibility for customer specific 
contracts on an exchange\_by\_exchange basis contingent on (1) the establishment of a customer\_specific price floor for the service in accordance with D.94\_09\_065 and (2) the demonstration of  competition within a given exchange as define
d below.  
\par \tab It is not enough that the LECs are required to include customer\_specific price floors in their advice letter filings.  We are concerned that without service\_wide price floors against which customer specific price floors can be co
mpared, there would be too much opportunity for gaming the price floor results.  Accordingly, for customer\_specific contracts covering those services which are moved from Category I to Category II pursuant to this decision, we shall add the
 second precondition requiring a showing of competition from at least one facilities\_based CLC.  We do not believe it is necessary to prohibit any LEC pricing flexibility until service\_wide price floors are established in OANAD in those lo
cal exchanges where such competition develops.    
\par \tab The mere lifting of legal barriers to competitive entry, however, is not evidence of competition sufficient to warrant LEC pricing flexibility for customer\_specific contracts.  Thus, we shall only permit the LECs to seek authority
 for Category II pricing flexibility on a case\_by\_case basis for customer\_specific contracts where the LEC makes a showing that at least one facilities\_based CLC is actively competing against it within the majority of exchanges served by
 the customer subject to the flexibly\_priced contract.  As evidence that the facilities\_based CLC is actively competing, the LEC must show that the CLC has executed an interconnection agreement with the LEC, has opened one or more NXX code
s within the exchange, and has originated or terminated traffic to CLC customers within the LEC's exchange.

ing revenue from the sales made by CLC resellers and can enter into a customer\_specific contract below the wholesale rate charged to the reseller.  By contrast, the facilities\_based CLC is independent of the LEC and can compete against the
 LEC based on the CLC's own cost structure irrespective of what wholesale rates the LEC may charge resellers.

\par \tab 1.\tab \ul Parties' Positions\ulnone 
\par \tab \tab \b0 Pacific, GTEC, Citizens, and DRA recommend that the LECs be granted authority to package Category I, II, and III services into a single offering.  According to Pacific and GTEC, there is strong customer demand for service 
packages, and the LECs would be at competitive disadvantage if they were not given the right to offer packages.  These four parties agree that the LECs should also provide the components of their packaged services on an individual basis, thu
s allowing customers to purchase only those services they want or need, and allaying any concerns about illegal tying arrangements or other anticompetitive bundling arrangements.    
\par \tab \tab Pacific recommends that the price floor for any package be the sum of the price floors of the individual parts of the package (including any imputation requirement in setting the price floors), with the same principle applying
 to a package's price ceiling.  If packaged Category I services do not have a price ceiling and floor, Pacific and DRA propose using the retail rates of the Category I services in establishing the price of the package's floor and ceiling.  T
URN asks that any imputation structure adopted by the Commission not result in an increase to basic exchange service rates.  Pacific believes that when packaging residential services, the existing imputation rules for subsidized services sho
uld apply, but that the subsidy payment must be included in the revenues received to determine whether the price is above the price floor.   
\par \tab \tab DRA recommends the lifting of the Commission's current prohibition on offering local exchange services in customer specific contracts that was established in D.94\_09\_065.  DRA recommends allowing such contracts if they are c
onsistent with GO\~96\_A contract rules adopted in IRD.  DRA also believes the Commission should require that the customer\_specific DEC for any local exchange services included in the contract be imputed in the contract floor.  Finally, DRA
 recommends that the LECs not be authorized to use express contract procedures for services for which no service\_wide floors and ceilings have been approved.  Nor does DRA believe that the LECs should be granted pricing flexibility below DE
C in customer\_specific contracts until service\_wide or rate element cost studies are approved.   
\par \tab \tab The Coalition opposes allowing Pacific and GTEC to bundle Category I services with Category II or III services.  The Coalition states that "tying" of noncompetitive basic local exchange service with competitive Category II and
 III services is per se anticompetitive when the LECs have sufficient economic power over basic local exchange services to restrain free competition for Category II and III services. 
\par \tab \tab The Coalition states that bundling of Category II and III services can be allowed, but only if established Commission safeguards for bundling are rigorously enforced.  These safeguards include those established in D.94\_09\_06
5 which precluded bundling in the form of contracts that include Category\~I services at other than tariffed rates; and D.94\_09\_065 and Resolution T\_15613 which prohibit the bundling of certain monopoly services, including residential sub
scriber service, basic exchange lines, ZUM, local usage, and the access line portion of semipublic telephone service.
\par \tab \tab The Coalition and TURN recommend the strict enforcement of the Commission imputation safeguards when bundling Category II services with Category III services to assure that monopoly elements are not subsidizing competitive pro
ducts.  Furthermore, the Coalition states its view that PU Code \{\{ 453, 532, and 2882.5 together dictate that LECs must demonstrate, prior to the offering of a package, the imputed underlying costs of any Category II service bundled with a
 Category III or nonregulated service.   
\par \tab \b 2.\tab \ul Discussion\ulnone \b0  
\par \tab \tab We conclude that the LECs should be granted the  flexibility to bundle Category II local exchange service with Category III services (including all services moved from Category\~I to II in this decision) as long as no "tying a
rrangements" are involved and our imputation rules are strictly observed.  This bundling comports with the rules in D.89\_10\_031 for bundling of Category II and III services.
\par \tab \tab A tying arrangement arises under antitrust laws when a seller conditions the sale of one product (the tying product) or service on the purchase of a separate product or service (the tied service).  Such arrangements are in vio
lation under Section\~1 of the Sherman Act, Section 3 of the Clayton Act and Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act.  In addition, there are two provisions of the Cartwright Act that can apply to tying arrangements; Sections 16720 and
 16727.  These two sections together have been characterized as analogous to Section 1 of the Sherman Act.  (\ul Corwin v. Los Angeles Newspaper Bureau, Inc.\ulnone , 4 Cal. 3d 842, 852 (1971).)
\par \tab \tab Tying arrangements generally involve the supplier's use of economic power or leverage in the market for the tying product to curb competition in the tied product and deny customers a free choice with respect to the products th
ey purchase.  Because such tying arrangements have been viewed as having little purpose other than the restriction of competition, they have been considered unlawful per se.  In two recent cases, \ul Jefferson Parish Hospital \ulnone \ul Dis
trict No. 2 v. Hyde\ulnone , 466 US 2 (1984( and \ul Eastman Kodak Co. v. \ulnone \ul Image Technical Services\ulnone , 504 US 451 (1992) the Court reaffirmed that tying arrangements are per se unlawful.
\par \tab \tab Accordingly, for any bundled service offering, the LECs must also offer customers the opportunity to purchase the service on a stand\_alone basis at the authorized tariff rates.  We find no reason to conclude that the mere aut
horization allowing the LECs to bundle Category II and III services on this basis constitutes an anticompetitive tying arrangement.  Federal case law supports the conclusion that bundling of services does not constitute an unlawful tying whe
n the offered terms do not preclude purchase of the separate services.  (\b Robert's Waikiki U\_Drive,\b0  732 F.2d 1403, 1407 (9th Cir. 1989).)

 LECs offering a bundled Category II and III service at a discount relative to the tariff rates for the separate services.   In \b Amerinet v. Xerox Corporation\b0 , 972 F.2d 1483, 1500 (8th Cir. 1992), the court found no unlawful tying mere
ly because the separate products were more expensive than the bundled product.  The court did find, however, that "an illegal tying arrangement may still be shown if the defendant's policy makes the purchasing of the tying and tied products 
together 'the only viable economic option...'"   \tab Thus, we will not prohibit the LECs from offering bundled Category II and III services at any discounts relative to the tariff rates for the separate services.  On the other hand, if the 
price differential between a bundled package and the separate services was so great that customers were economically coerced into buying unwanted or overpriced Category III services, then could a valid claim that an lawful tying had occurred
.  The opportunity for 
\par the LECs to offer a bundled service which is a customer's only viable economic option, however, is constrained to the extent that the bundled price of the Category II product cannot go below the price floor and the separate Category II 
prices cannot go above the ceiling.  In any event, Pacific and GTEC are placed on notice that any bundled arrangements they enter into pursuant to our adopted rules are subject to applicable antitrust laws regarding unlawful tying arrangemen
ts, and they  shall be liable for any applicable penalties or sanctions resulting from violation of those laws.  
\par \tab \tab Accordingly, effective March\~31, 1996, LECs may bundle Category II and III services as long as customers are able to purchase the individual services separately at tariffed rates, and as long as proper  imputation of price fl
oors for each separately unbundled Category\~II service is verified.  As prescribed under PU Code \{\~2282.5:  "Cross\_subsidy of the enhanced services by the noncompetitive services offered by the local exchange telephone corporation is pro
hibited."  For any bundled tariffed Category II services, we shall require a full demonstration of the imputed underlying tariffed rates.  We shall not allow bundling of Category\~I services.
\par \b D.  \ul Geographic Deaveraging\ulnone 
\par \tab 1.\tab \ul Parties' Positions\ulnone 
\par \tab \tab \b0 Pacific, GTEC, LDDS, Citizens and DCA support allowing the LECs to set cost\_based, geographically deaveraged rates, with geographically\_based costs determined in the OANAD proceeding.  Pacific would make one exception fo
r residential services which Pacific believes should not have geographic\_based prices.  These parties generally agree that geographic deaveraging provides correct economic signals to both CLCs and to customers.  Without geographic deaveragi
ng, the CLCs may be encouraged to enter low cost areas protected by the umbrella of averaged LEC prices, and dissuaded from serving high cost areas where the LECs charge below their costs due to averaged LEC prices.  Unless the geographic pr
ice distortions are corrected, these parties believe a truly cost\_based competitive marketplace cannot emerge.   
\par \tab \tab To the extent that the cost to serve high cost areas makes the price prohibitive, Citizens recommends that the Commission's universal service system be used to ensure that prices are kept at an affordable level.  If the Commis
sion forces GTEC to maintain average prices, GTEC recommends the Commission mandate that a universal service contribution be collected from CLCs to address the revenue needs associated with high cost areas.  
\par \tab \tab The Coalition and TURN oppose geographic rate deaveraging.  According to the Coalition, allowing entry by CLCs will not affect the LECs' overwhelming market power which will continue to persist because, among other things, man
y ratepayers will not have competitive alternatives available to them for many years to come.  The Coalition states that if the Commission permits rate deaveraging immediately following entry, the LECs intend to wield their market power by i
mposing significant rate increases on large numbers of ratepayers with no competitive options for local exchange service, resulting in widespread discrimination of the sort that averaged rates were designed to limit.  Moreover, the Coalition
 believes that deaveraging would result in significant anticompetitive conduct by the LECs who would drop rates in areas where they face incipient competition and underwrite those decreases by raising rates to captive customers.  
\par \tab \tab The Coalition recommends that deaveraging not be permitted until there are sufficient competitive alternatives available to ratepayers to limit potential discrimination and anticompetitive behavior.  However, if geographic dea
veraging is allowed before then, the Coalition recommends that it be subject to four conditions.  First, there should be no deaveraging of residential basic service given that the Universal Service Fund will ensure that LECs are made whole f
or the cost of providing basic service in high cost areas.  Second, there should be no deaveraging until OANAD cost studies have been completed and verified by the Commission.  Third, deaveraging should be offered

e lack of competitive alternatives available to them.  This means that all ratepayers with the same cost characteristics should receive the same rates.  Finally, deaveraging should not be permitted below the exchange level to avoid the admin
istrative burden of many different rates for the same service.   
\par \tab \b 2.\tab \ul Discussion\ulnone 
\par \tab \tab \b0 We recognize that geographic deaveraging may promote more efficient pricing.  Under the existing LEC rate structure which is based on statewide averages, retail rates do not reflect the costs of serving different geographi
c regions.  Once LEC rates are geographically deaveraged and prices are allowed to more closely match costs of service, CLCs will have a greater incentive to enter new geographic markets which were not previously cost effective to serve.  Th
us, geographic deaveraging should increase rather than constrain competition.  CLCs will be encouraged to enter a geographic market if they can offer a more competitive price than the LEC.  While we agree that allowing geographically cost\_b
ased prices may be necessary in a competitive environment, statewide average rates must remain in place for LECs for the present and until relevant cost studies by relevant geographic region have been completed and approved.  
\par \tab \tab Before deaveraged rates can be implemented, studies must be completed to determine the appropriate costs of serving different geographic regions.  Although cost studies are presently being prepared in the OANAD proceeding to d
evelop rates for unbundled network elements, those cost studies will not necessarily provide all the necessary information needed to determine geographically deaveraged costs.  Moreover, in the Universal Service proceedings, we are consideri
ng using a "proxy" cost study to estimate the cost of basic service to residential customers 
\par throughout the state based on geography.  Under the proxy factor method, we would examine a sample of actual costs from different geographic areas.  Accordingly, we shall coordinate with the ongoing work in companion proceedings and sub
sequently determine a procedural schedule for the preparation, review, and approval of cost and price studies which can be used for adoption of geographically deaveraged rates.  The studies should provide data which would separately identify
 wholesale and retail costs and prices.  Appropriate coordination between the OANAD, Universal Service, and NRF proceedings will assure that relevant cost data are shared among these proceedings accordingly. 
\par \tab \tab The Universal Service High Cost Voucher fund as proposed in the Universal Service proceeding, may reduce the need for rate deaveraging in the residential market.  The availability of subsidies from the fund should allow LECs a

\par \tab \tab Once appropriate geographically deaveraged prices have  been allowed, we shall then be prepared to revise the rules in this proceeding authorizing implementation of geographically deaveraged wholesale and retail rates.  After 
hearing from parties, we may also consider implementing geographically deaveraged pricing gradually on an exchange\_by\_exchange basis as cost data becomes available.  We find no necessity to require a separate showing of some minimum level 
of market share loss by the LECs or other related measures before we approve the use of geographically deaveraged Category II services.  We shall, however, require that each LEC offer the same geographically deaveraged rates to all ratepayer
s within a designated geographic region.   This requirement is consistent with PU Code \{\~453(a) which states:  "No public utility shall as to rates, charges, service, facilities, or in any other respect, make or grant any preference or adv
antage to any corporation or person subject any corporation or person to any prejudice or disadvantage."  These restrictions will provide appropriate safeguards against the risk of discriminatory pricing

\par \tab \tab \b0 Pacific and GTEC recommend that CLCs be required to use existing NXX rating areas to rate and bill calls until long\_term number portability is implemented.  The LECs argue that the use of inconsistent rating areas could r

{\footnote 
{\fs16 \up6 \chftn }\pard \li0 \ri0 \fi0 \ql \sl240 \slmult1 \hyphpar1 \f1 \fs24   Misrated calls could occur where CLC's NXX codes  inconsistently span several of the LEC's rating areas, causing the LEC to be unable to determine in which of
 its rating areas the call actually terminated, thereby precluding the LEC from correctly billing the call in accordance with its local/toll bands.
\par 
\par   }}\up0   The LECs are concerned that the misrated calls would have the largest effect on the LECs' high volume customers, the very LEC customers that the CLCs would target.  In addition, the misbilling caused by the use of disparate r
ate areas could impair the Commission's ability to determine what compensation mechanism is appropriate after the conclusion of the one\_year interim period for bill and keep.  
\par \tab \tab The LECs further argue that using existing rating areas will minimize customer confusion.  According to the LECs, customers have an understanding borne of experience of what constitutes a local or toll call.  If each CLC were 
allowed its own rating area, the designation of a call as local or toll would change each time a call was placed to a customer of a different carrier.  The result would be customers having difficulty in knowing whether they are making a loca
l or toll call.  
\par \tab \tab The LECs argue that inconsistent rating areas would affect all carriers nationally and should be undertaken only after the development of new national standards.  Finally, Pacific is concerned that allowing CLCs to use differe
nt rating areas could impair the reliability of the E\_911 network.  Pacific does not oppose modifying E\_911 to cope with different rating areas, but only after careful study. 
\par \tab \tab Pacific acknowledges that a requirement for rating area consistency may accelerate NPA exhaustion.  However, Pacific believes accelerated number exhaust is preferable to thousands of misrated calls per day.  Pacific adds that 
its recommendation for consistent rating areas is meant to facilitate local competition, and thus the costs caused by the accelerated NPA exhaust should be shared by the industry.  In all, Pacific estimates that it will incur $70 million

\par \tab \tab \b0 Citizens supports all carriers being required to use the same NXX rating areas as already established for the incumbent LECs.  Without rating area consistency, Citizens believes there will be customer confusion.  In additi
on, Citizens states that inconsistent rating areas will cause carriers nationally to experience serious technical problems in identifying, transporting, and pricing calls.  Citizens does not believe that a requirement for consistent rating a
reas should restrict carriers from developing different calling areas to accommodate customer need and demand.
\par \ul \b Coalition\ulnone 
\par \tab \tab \b0 The Coalition opposes the requirement of consistent rate centers since it would exacerbate the already serious problem of statewide number exhaust, and would force each CLC to open a unique NXX in every existing LEC rate c
enter in which the CLC offers service.  Given that Pacific and GTEC together have more than 559 rate centers, each CLC providing service throughout the two LECs' service territories would need to obtain at least 559 NXX number blocks totalin
g more than 5,590,000 telephone numbers, causing immediate and widespread number exhaust.  The Coalition is concerned that the resulting number exhaust would shut the CLCs out of some or all markets due to a lack of NXX codes, which would be
nefit the LECs but impede competition.  
\par \tab \tab The Coalition is concerned that as number exhaust accelerates due to the use of consistent rate centers, solutions to the problem could further impede competition.  As an example, the Coalition cites a CACD report dated Novemb
er 9, 1995, regarding number exhaust for the 310 area code.  In their report, CACD recommends a freeze on assigning numbers when only 48 NXXs remain, and that there be a lottery for the allocation of the remaining codes.  The Coalition belie
ves the freeze and lottery could preclude new entrants from obtaining NXXs and offering service in the 310 area.  
\par \tab \tab The Coalition states that call misrating is a minor and temporary problem that will be solved by true local number portability (LNP).  According to the Coalition, prior to the implementation of true LNP, few customers will be 
impacted by call misrating since competition will be slow to develop and there will be few CLC customers.  Moreover, the call misrating applies only to facilities\_based CLCs, not resale CLCs, further limiting the number of affected customer
s.  Finally, there will be no call rating problem for the customers of facilities\_based CLCs who use interim LNP since their telephone numbers (and thus their rating center location) will remain the same.    
\par \tab \tab The Coalition is concerned about a co\_carrier agreement between Pacific and MFS Intelenet of California (MFS).  Under the agreement, MFS would obtain at no charge a unique NXX in every Pacific Bell rate center area that MFS o
ffers service.  The Coalition is concerned the agreement would exacerbate the number exhaust problem by requiring MFS to obtain full blocks of 10,000 numbers even where MFS had no need for so many numbers; and would discriminate in favor of 
MFS by providing MFS with NXXs at no charge while all other CLCs are charged to open new codes.  
\par \tab \tab To reduce the problems associated with using inconsistent rate centers, the Coalition recommends the Commission adopt the proposal by TCG to modify the Terminating Point Master (TPM).  Currently, to rate a call, all carriers u
se a national file called the TPM, which identifies the rate center to which a particular NPA\_NXX number is assigned.  TCG's proposal would modify the TPM so it could recognize that a particular NXX has been assigned to a CLC.  Once the TPM
 has recognized that a particular NXX was assigned to a CLC, the rating system would look to a separate file in order to properly rate the call.  TCG believes its proposal can be implemented fairly easily with little cost.  The Coalition not
es that several facilities\_based IECs, including AT&T, MCI, and Sprint, would be as impacted by TCG's proposal as the LECs, yet these IECs are willing to pursue it further.  The Coalition therefore recommends that if the Commission feels co
mpelled to address call misrating prior to true LNP, the Commission approve TCG's proposal and move forward with an examination and implementation of the technical details associated with its adoption via workshops.
\par \tab \tab The Coalition recommends that the Commission consider implementing "super rate centers" in the short term to minimize possible call misrating.  Under this approach, CLCs would obtain an NXX covering a number of current LEC exc
hange areas.  The number of LEC exchanges subsumed by a CLC super rate center could be calibrated to make the number as small as possible while avoiding number exhaust.  This calibration could vary by geographic area in order to account for 
the varying risks of number exhaust.  The super rate center approach would only need to be in effect until either TCG's solution is deployed, or until permanent LNP is deployed.  
\par \tab \tab During the period that the TCG proposal to modify the TPM is being evaluated and tested, the Coalition recommends that the Commission address possible customer confusion through customer notification.  The Coalition believes t
hat providing information and a list of "local NXXs" in the form of directory guides, bill inserts, and other mailings would be an efficient and inexpensive means of preventing customer confusion, and would avoid the number\_exhaust\_produci
ng requirement that CLCs obtain NXXs in every rating center where they have customers.  The Coalition believes that customers would quickly learn from experience, just as they do now, which calls are local and which are not.  
\par \tab \tab The Coalition believes the LECs have caused customer confusion due to inaccurate information the LECs have disseminated to their customers regarding how calls are currently rated.  To alleviate the customer confusion, the Coal
ition asks that the Commission require Pacific and GTEC to make a special mailing that would (1) apprise customers of the correct manner in which calls are rated, (2) advise customers that in order to know whether a call is local, ZUM, or to
ll, the customers must refer to the "NXX charts" in their phone books or to the "detachable card" that the Coalition recommends that Pacific should be ordered to provide to its customers.  Finally, the Coalition recommends that Pacific and G
TEC be required to provide information for customers on how to reach carriers when calls have been misrated. 
\par \tab \tab The Coalition states that the use of inconsistent rate centers can be done without harm to the E\_911 system by arranging for special trunking where necessary to assure proper routing of E\_911 calls.  
\par \tab \tab The Coalition is opposed to Pacific's request for authority to recover costs for accelerated NPA exhaust.  The Coalition believes that accelerated NPA exhaust is due mostly to the LECs insistence that CLCs use consistent ratin
g areas, and that they should therefore be the parties to bear the costs for accelerated NPA exhaust.  The Coalition also believes that the costs for area code splits are part of the LECs' ongoing costs of business under NRF, and that Pacifi
c has never before received Z\_factor treatment for costs to split area codes. 
\par \ul \b DRA\ulnone 
\par \tab \tab \b0 DRA recommends that the Commission require CLCs to match the LECs' existing rate centers.  DRA believes that such a policy will reduce customer and carrier confusion about the local or toll nature of a particular call.  DR
A doubts that use of consistent rate centers will substantially increase number exhaust over the next few years since DRA believes that competition will be slow to develop.  DRA states that implementing true number portability will ultimatel
y eliminate the necessity of matching LEC and CLC rate centers.  Until then, DRA finds the proposals to modify the TPM or use super rate centers to be infeasible since the proposals are too vague or suffer from other defects.   
\par \tab \tab DRA recommends that CLCs be allowed to offer local calling areas that equal or exceed the size of the LECs' 12\_mile local calling area, but that CLCs should not be permitted to offer local calling areas smaller than the LECs'
 local calling areas.  DRA believes that the ability of CLCs to offer larger local calling areas may enable them to gain local market share and thereby generate some of the consumer benefits that local exchange competition is expected to pro
vide.

 Assuming CLCs are to be charged for NXX code openings, the result would be increased costs for CLCs to enter new rating areas or to be foreclosed or delayed from entry into certain areas if no more NXX codes were available within a rating a
rea.  Another negative result of accelerated number exhaustion is the added costs and customer disruption resulting from more frequent NPA relief measures such as area code splits.  Yet, while we remain concerned regarding these consequences
, we must weigh these problems against the negative customer impacts of abandoning our policy of rating area consistency, (i.e., misrating of calls and customer confusion).   
\par  \tab \tab Although customers may not all precisely understand how calls are rated, they generally have some sense of which calls are rated as local.  Immediately eliminating any CLC requirements to match existing rating areas without a
ppropriate consumer education would likely lead to customer confusion and misrating of calls.  We also agree that these negative impacts would be experienced chiefly by the incumbent LECs' customers and could create a competitive disadvantag
e for the LECs.  
\par \tab \tab We conclude that under the rating area proposals of either the LECs or the Coalition, there is some risk of negative impacts, and no solution can be absolutely problem free.   We must weigh these impacts and adopt a solution t
hat results in the least overall negative effects.  On balance, we conclude that the best solution is one which preserves scarce number resources and promotes the development of facilities\_based competition.  Requiring CLCs to open a separa
te NXX code in every rate center in which they serve customers would create an unacceptable acceleration of number exhaustion and inhibit the growth of facilities\_based competition.  Accordingly, effective March 31, 1996, we shall not requi
re CLCs to open a separate NXX code in each rate center in which they offer service. 
\par  \tab We also recognize, however, concurrently with the lifting of this restriction, we need to address parties' concerns over the potential for customer confusion and call misrating resulting from inconsistencies between LEC and CLC NX
X rating areas.  While the problems associated with the use of different rating areas between CLCs and LECs are of concern to us, we believe they can be reasonably dealt with by developing appropriate mitigation measures through technical wo
rkshops.  The timely implementation of appropriate mitigation procedures following these workshops will provide for a transition period to mitigate any call misrating and customer confusion resulting from the use of different NXX rating area
s between LECs and CLCs.  Accordingly, we shall direct CACD to convene a technical workshop during March 1996 to address necessary mitigation measures on a priority basis to mitigate call misrating and to educate consumers regarding the mann
er in which the rating of local calls of CLC subscribers will be determined.  CACD shall prepare a draft workshop report for parties comments following the workshop and present the final report to the ALJ no later than May\~17, 1996. 
\par \tab \tab We believe that the measures developed through the technical workshops can be implemented before any significant impacts from the use of differing CLC/LEC rating areas would be felt.  The need to open NXX codes will only be an
 issue for facilities\_based CLCs since resellers simply rely on LECs' existing NXX code designations.  Facilities\_based CLCs, however, must first execute interconnection agreements, build or acquire necessary facilities, open NXX codes, an
d actually sign up subscribers before beginning to offer local exchange service.  Given the pace of progress toward facilities\_based competition since the market was opened on January 1, 1996, we do not believe that a significant number of 
customers would be served using a CLC's NXX codes before appropriate mitigation measures could be put into place.     
\par \tab \tab In any event, we shall direct Commission Advisory and Compliance Division (CACD) to monitor the NXX code assignment process.  We shall also require that until appropriate mitigation measures are adopted, any facilities\_based 
CLC which enters into a commitment to begin providing local exchange service to a customer served by an NXX rating area which is inconsistent with that of the LEC shall first notify CACD.  
\par \tab \tab The topics to be covered in the workshop are discussed below. 
\par \tab \tab While the TCG proposal to modify the TPM is not presently developed sufficiently to permit its implementation, it has the potential to be implemented with additional work.  We direct the CACD to convene a workshop to identify 
the additional implementation details which would need to be resolved to make the TCG proposal workable and to develop a timetable for implementing those details.  To the extent workshop participants are unable to reach agreement on particul
ar details, they may file separate comments dissenting from the report.  We will consider the results of the workshop report and assess whether to implement the TCG proposal or other alternatives including a timetable for implementing the su
per rate center proposal and for implementing a customer awareness program to inform them concerning the new procedures for determining how a local call will be rated.
\par \tab \tab Likewise, the MCI proposal to use a "super rate center" approach is not sufficiently developed to implement as an interim solution until the TCG proposal can be implemented.  MCI does not explain how the size of each "super ra
te center" would be determined.  If sized too large, it would not really serve to avoid customer confusion, and if sized too small, it would fail to alleviate the scarcity of NXX codes.  
\par \tab \tab In considering any change in existing rating area consistency, we must also assure that E\_911 service is not impaired.  The existing NXX\_to\_rating\_point system supports E\_911 service.  Pacific's E\_911 Tandem Selective Ro
uting function is NXX and wire center based.  The Selective Routing feature routes calls to the appropriate Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) based on the Automatic Number Identification (ANI) and the associated

\par \tab \tab Each Tandem Selective Route receives data from a number of corresponding rate centers and distributes the E\_911 calls to the appropriate PSAP.  The PSAP dispatches the appropriate agency (i.e., fire, ambulance) to the caller 
based on the caller's location information as recorded in the Master Street Address Guide (MSAG),  If the ESN system fails, the Selective Routing telephone number database serves as a redundant safeguard.  This safeguard is based on the rate
 center and associated NXX of the caller's ANI.
\par \tab \tab The Coalition claims the E\_911 problem could be solved by requiring separate dedicated trunks.  We believe, however, the technical details of how such trunking arrangements can be implemented should be worked out expeditiousl
y in technical workshops.  Parties should address via workshop the best means to ensure E\_911 service reliability as the existing NXX code assignment procedures are changed.  Before any CLC begins offering service through an NXX rating area
 which differs from the LEC, we shall require that they first provide assurance to CACD that separate dedicated trunks are in place to handle E\_911 calls or that equivalent means are provided to ensure the integrity of E\_911 service.
\par \tab \tab Another technical concern to be addressed in the workshops is to assure that the measurement of local traffic would not be impaired by the elimination of rating area consistency.  In D.95\_12\_056, we directed all carriers to 
provide measurements of local versus toll traffic.  We must therefore assure that any subsequent rating area differences allow for the ability to measure local traffic.
\par  \tab We also need a developed timetable regarding the preparation, dissemination, and assimilation of any customer awareness program to educate customers concerning the new procedures for determining the rating of local calls involving
 CLC customers and to consider any other appropriate mitigation measures to deal with any customer confusion or negative reaction which may still occur.  
\par \tab \tab As part of Phase III, we shall therefore also give consideration to proposed means of implementing appropriate mitigation measures and a timetable for doing so.
\par \tab \tab Rating area consistency is only one of many factors determining the rate with which number exhaustion will occur.  In D.95\_08\_052, we directed that as part of this rulemaking, the assigned ALJ solicit comments regarding a st
atewide policy for dealing with "California's exploding number usage" and appropriate remedies for area code relief.

 states that similar bill inserts were required by the IRD decision, and GTEC intends to submit the bill inserts and mailings to the Commission for approval.  GTEC's states that its costs for implementing local competition could be affected 
by the final rules adopted by the Commission.  GTEC thus recommends that the Commission review its actual implementation costs, and requests authority to seek recovery of additional costs it incurs as a result of the final local competition 
rules. 
\par \tab GTEC believes a surcharge on all end users is a fair method to recover its implementation costs since the Commission has ruled that local competition is in the public interest and thus all telecommunications users in the State shou
ld equally bear the costs of local competition.  In addition, GTEC believes an all end user surcharge avoids GTEC subsidizing the CLCs' market entry, thus advancing the Commission's goals of economic efficiency and regulatory parity.
\par \ul \b Coalition\ulnone 
\par \tab \b0 The Coalition supports LECs being given an opportunity to recover their recorded implementation costs following a review and approval process conducted by the Commission.  To the extent the Commission permits recovery of implem
entation costs, the Coalition recommends that they be recovered through a surcharge on all LECs and CLCs in proportion to the number of access lines they serve.   
\par \tab The Coalition opposes the Commission pre\_approving the LECs' estimated implementation costs for two reasons.  First, the Coalition believes that the LECs' cost estimates are speculative since they are forecasts.  Second, the Coali
tion believes the LECs have overstated their implementation costs by including costs the LECs would have incurred in any event.  In particular, the Coalition states that GTEC is not entitled to recover costs for customer notification since t
his is a marketing cost, not an implementation cost.  The Coalition states that all LECs and CLCs will provide information about their services to customers.  In addition, the Coalition states that all LECs and CLCs are required to provide i
nformation about the prices, terms, and conditions of their basic exchange service pursuant to Universal Service rules.  The Coalition states that CLCs will not be allowed to pass along these costs, and neither should the LECs.
\par \ul \b TURN\ulnone 
\par \tab \b0 TURN opposes LECs recovering implementation costs for several reasons.  First, TURN finds the LECs' proposals provide them with an incentive to drive up implementation costs in order to impede competition.  Second, TURN believe
s that the LECs benefit from the opening of the local exchange market to competition since the LECs may in turn be allowed into the interLATA market; hence the LECs should bear the implementation costs, not the ratepayers.  Third, TURN state
s that the CLCs must bear all of their own implementation costs, and the LECs will be given an unfair competitive advantage if they are able to recover their implementation costs from ratepayers.  Finally, TURN opposes GTEC's recovery of cos
ts for customer notification since TURN considers this a marketing cost, not an implementation cost.  TURN states that Universal Service rules require that all LECs and CLCs provide information to their customers about the prices, terms, and
 conditions of their basic exchange service.  TURN states that CLCs will not be allowed to pass along these costs, and neither should the LECs.  
\par \tab If the Commission decides to allow LECs to recover implementation costs, TURN supports the costs being recovered via a surcharge on all local exchange providers in proportion to the number of lines they serve.  
\par \ul \b DRA\ulnone 
\par \tab \b0 DRA opposes allowing the LECs to recover any costs for implementing local exchange competition.  DRA believes that the LECs' costs will be offset by the benefits the LECs will receive by being allowed to compete in each other's
 service territories and ultimately being allowed into the interLATA market as a result of local exchange competition.  
\par \tab DRA also finds the LECs' requests to be one sided since they call for the ratepayers to absorb all of the costs but share none of the profits the LECs may realize as a result of local competition.  DRA notes that CLCs will also hav
e their own implementation costs for which they have no guarantee of recovery.  DRA thus sees the LECs being given an unfair advantage if they were guaranteed recovery of their implementation costs while the CLCs were not.  
\par \tab If the Commission allows the LECs to recover implementation costs, DRA recommends that the Commission first review the LECs' actual implementation costs and then authorize their recovery via a surcharge on the ratepayers of the LEC
 that incurred the costs.  In addition, DRA recommends that the costs attributable to a specific service, such as number portability, resale, or interconnection, should be recovered in the rates charged to the purchasers of those services, a
nd not from a general surcharge applied to all end users or a specific company's ratepayers.  Finally, DRA supports setting a separate phase for a generic review of number exhaust and code opening issues.
\par \b C.  \ul Discussion\ulnone 
\par \tab \b0 The LECs' request to recover implementation costs raise issues as to (1) what costs the LECs will incur in connection with implementing the Commission's local competition rules, and (2) whether, how, or to what extent the LECs 
should be compensated for such costs.

\par \tab It would send an inappropriate signal to the LECs if we were merely to preapprove any of their estimated expenses.  The LECs should be financially responsible for the consequences of their management decisions on how to implement c
ompetition and should have the incentive to be as efficient as possible in implementing competition.  Guaranteed preapproval negates the incentives of the LECs to manage its implementation costs efficiently.  
\par   \tab We recognize, however, that the LECs will need to perform various  activities as outlined in their testimony to implement the infrastructure for local exchange competition and that some level of costs will be incurred by the LECs
 associated with these activities.  Moreover, we expect society as a whole to benefit from the implementation of local exchange competition.    Accordingly, we conclude that reasonably incurred costs to implement competitive local exchange s
ervice are appropriate, and it is not unreasonable that end\_users pay for such costs.
\par \tab The LECs' proposal for an end\_user surcharge has the appeal of spreading any implementation costs among all customers who are beneficiaries of a competitive market including customers of the CLCs.  We have imposed end\_user surcha
