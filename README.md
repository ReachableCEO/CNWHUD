# CNWHUD

## Introduction

Welcome to the CNWHUD repository. This is where Charles N Wyble (aka @ReachableCEO) stores his :

* public notes (works in progress, observations, snippets). Nothing in this repository should be considered public material statements in relation to the TSYS enterprise.
* shell fragments
* VsCode profiles

He used to use this repository as his TODO system, and utilized a local vscode kanbn , but is now using Taiga. You'll see evidence of all that in the git history.
