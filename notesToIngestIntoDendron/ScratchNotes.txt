### Server room power expenses 


outlet 1 (compute load)

Uptime	30T02:15:42
Total power consumed: 1458.674 kWh
Curent: 8amps 

AC load was 8 to 13 amps. I will be conservative in my estimate and say 8 amps sustained and same kwh (1458).

1458 *2 = 2,916 kwh 


Reliant per kwh cost: $0.090942/kWh , so let's call it 10c comes to 291.60 

12 months at 291.60 is $3,499.20

I am going to round up to 300.00 per month for $3,600.00

 This app is set up to authenticate with the Cloudron User Directory. Cloudron users can login and use it immediately.

This app is pre-setup with an admin account. The initial credentials are:

Username: admin
Password: changeme123
Email: admin@cloudron.local

Please change the admin password and email immediately.

Users from Cloudron have to be synced into Dolibarr manually by running sync-users.sh in a webterminal into the app, those can use Dolibarr but the pre-setup admin account has to be used to delegate rights to those users.
Please see the Dolibarr documentation for helpful information and common topics on this app. If you need further help, refer to Cloudron's Dolibarr forum section.
