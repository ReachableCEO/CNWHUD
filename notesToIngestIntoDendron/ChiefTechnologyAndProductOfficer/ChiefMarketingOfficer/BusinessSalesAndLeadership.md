```
The pitch in their email is "plug & play SaaS analytics tool".
This pitch tells me nearly nothing. It doesn't say what I would use it
for, what benefits it offers, how it stands compared to other solutions
on the market, or even any details about what platform(s) it supports.
So basically unless I happen to currently have no solution and am
actively looking for one, then I don't care. Which I would guess is
about 99.999% of the people who received their email.
