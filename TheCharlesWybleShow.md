# The Charles Wyble Show

## early years

### Tenant 1  - exclusive expert

#### the first time

become an exclusive expert at something. it's key.

from 14 to 18 years old i spent 10,000+ hours develping deep expertise in the micrsofot file formats. excel specfically. i am a co-author of the only comprehesive documentation outside
micrsoft. i was the very first person to request the formats after the consent decree. 


9/11/2001 was the first day of my senior high school year 

less than a year later at 17 i was recruite by the department of defense to support global counter terrorism operations. 

why? i was the worlds expert on microsoft file formats (specifically excel).

yes terrorists use excel. i supported sensitive site operations (SSE) pipelines that sourced, colated, processed, exploited intelligence 
in country to support industrial scale, stovepope counter terrorism ops


#### the second time

I .... "helped people do stuff". We will simply say "offensive cyber" , but you know before 2010. No , it's not on my linkedin. Only people who are glorified metasploit operators put "NSA Cyber Ops" on linkedin. Because that's not useufl OSINT for our enemies. I was there in the beginning and I was an early pioneer.

#### the third time

This little balloon project. It's nothing big and profesisonal like (insert co name here) #TODO , just some 30/40 somethings in a garage with a dream and a world 
class leadership/founding engineering team drawn from our mid career rolodexes and relenteless pounding of the pavement. 

### Tenant 2  - Get comforable being right 

9 billion in capital spend for TWDC in 52 weeks 
Thre people being my gatekeepers and nothing under 10 million in rev impact was worth my time

I was 25 . It was scary and exhiliarting 

Critical path shot caller for million/billon revenue/capex make/break decisions my whole career 
Took companies public. Lots of firing. 
Make decisions quickly and own em. YOLO is real. Fime only moves forward



### Tenant 2  - OODA is all
