

Over the last quarter or so, I have been holding (regular) 1 on 1 meetings with members of the TSYS board of directors and advisory board. I have been 
getting high quality feedback, perspective, analysis. 

The overall message is to be outcome focused. Delegate as much as possible. Focus on being CEO (get out of the COO/CIO/CTO aspects).

The immediate action that I'm taking, is to update this blog on a regular basis, with Daily Standup posts. This will ensure that I remain transparent and accountable to all stakeholders in the TSYS Group mission. 

The posts will be updated as I progress, and then a "finished/shipped" label will be applied (and post will be added to that category).
