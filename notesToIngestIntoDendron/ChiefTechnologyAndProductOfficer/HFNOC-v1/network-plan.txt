This is a highly available system with primary hosting at KNEL HQ and fully 
redundant backup on two ec2 availability zones. It contains the network 
command and control systems used for provisioning,billing,monitoring etc.

Please see the SCW-OSS for exhaustive detail.

Packet pushing:

The packet pushing functions of the network are split into 5 layers:

1) Network core POP location (horizontal/distributed network core layer)
These are located in computer rooms on mountain tops throughout southern
California. These locations terminate bridged Black Diamond PtP back haul 
links over 3650 frequencies.

These points of presence consist of:

A) vyatta based x86 rack mount systems
B) switching gear 
C) UBNT.com 3650 and 700mhz antennas 


2) Network Aggregation POP Location (horizontal/distributed network aggregation layer)
(Black diamond nodes) (30% revenue sharing)
These are located in peoples houses that have been friends of the project for some time:
